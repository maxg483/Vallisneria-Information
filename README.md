# Vallisneria Literature
This is a repository for public outreach and information about the genus Vallisneria. Currently, within the U.S. there has been several introduced Vallisneria species that have become rapidly invasive throughout several waterbodies and river systems. These recent invasions have shown that our current understanding about the genus Vallisneria and many of its species is actually more shallow than anticipated with many studies focusing on one of the two described species of Lowden 1982. This repository will contain information regarding our current biological, ecological, management, and evolutionary understanding of this genus. Please reach out to mgebhart@gri.msstate.edu if you would like to discuss any of this information or have questions regarding the Vallisneria genus!
